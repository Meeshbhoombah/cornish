# server

## Development
### Prerequisites
### Installation
Clone the project.

#### Development
Run the server and watch for changes with `cargo watch`.
```
cargo watch -x run -c
```

This may be simplest way to work on the server during development. All changes
will be automatically reflected and rerun.
